### Installation

#### Prerequisites
This project depends on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and `react-native-cli`. The `Node.js` installation method varies from platform to platform.

If you are using a Debian distribution, please follow the steps below,

```sh
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Or, if you are using some other linux distribution or a different platform, please follow the instruction provided [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

`react-native-cli` module requires a global installation.

```sh
$ sudo npm install -g react-native-cli
```

Now, change CWD to project root and install dependency modules.
```sh
$ npm install
```

Create a gradle property file by renaming `gradle.properties.example` as `gradle.properties` (located in `android/`)

##### FCM Support

###### Android

FCM requires a configuration file (`google-services.json`) to work. In order to
get the file, follow the steps bellow.

- Go to your project in [https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com), or create one.
- Now, from project Settings > General > Your apps, use "Add APP" to add an
android app to the project
- `google-services.json` will now be available for download

###### iOS

TODO

Once the FCM configuration file is added, app will start to receive notifications
without the necessity of taking any further step. But, if the app requires
advanced feature like Android `click_action`, then some [additional
configuration](https://github.com/evollu/react-native-fcm#config-for-notification-and-click_action-in-android) will be required.

For a more detailed configuration instruction, please visit the FCM module
[documentation](https://github.com/evollu/react-native-fcm#configure-firebase-console).

#### Development
Create a configuration file by copying `application.json.example` as `application.json` (located in `app/config`)

Now, start the JS server.

```sh
$ react-native start
```

And, finally deploy the development app. to a device / emulator using,

```sh
$ react-native run-android
$ react-native run-ios
```

One way of logging is to use any of the following commands

```sh
$ react-native log-android
$ react-native log-ios
```

#### Production

##### Android

Create a keystore for the production app signing. You may update the available parameters (e.g. keystore name, alias, validity) to fit your requirement.

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore primary-release-key.keystore -alias keystore_alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

Now copy the keystore file to `android/app` directory.

In the global `gradle.properties` file (located in `android/` directory), update the `STORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS` and `STORE_FILE` parameter with your keystore parameters.

Finally generate the release build using,

```
react-native run-android --flavor=release
```

which generates a release apk in `android/app/build/outputs/apk` directory.
